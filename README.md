 “Netra : Network Scanning Tools” 

Description: 

The proposed project “Netra“is a robust network scanning tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) like Zenmap. The tool will provide users with an intuitive interface for conducting network scans, identifying service version, and identifying potential security vulnerabilities. 

 

Objectives of the Tool: 

    To provide users with a user-friendly interface for conducting network scans. 

    To facilitate the analysis of network topology and device connectivity. 

    To assist in the identification of open ports, services, and potential security risks within a network. 

    To support various scanning techniques, including ping scans, port scans, OS detection, and service version detection. 

    To generate comprehensive scan reports for further analysis and decision-making. 

Functions and Features: 

    Scan Options: Provide support for various scan types, including ping scans, TCP/UDP port scans,  

    Scan Scheduling: Allow users to schedule scans to run at specified intervals automatically. 

    Reporting: Generate detailed scan reports with information about discovered hosts, open ports, services, and potential security issues. 

    Customization: Enable users to customize scan parameters and options based on their specific requirements. 

     Exporting: Support exporting scan results in common formats such as CSV or XML for further analysis and more. 

 

Language and Tools Used to Create: 

    Programming Language: Python 

    GUI Framework: Tkinter 

    Network Scanning Library: Scapy,Socket

    Development Environment: Visual Studio Code 

 

Target Audience and Operating Systems: 

    Network Administrators & Network Security Professionals 

    Penetration Testers and Security Auditors 

    Supported OS: Linux, windows and macOS. 

 
Netra is a college project done for understanding how networking protocols and Nmap works.It was projected to start from may 25, 2024 but start from june.
